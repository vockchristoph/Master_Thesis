Introduction:
3D-printing technology is developed further and is increasingly integrated into all kinds of manufacturing and fabrication processes, even in industrial applications. Combined with the demand for renewable and environmentally friendly solutions for manufacturing, quick and reliable recycling methods reduce the waste of plastics that are already produced. Contrary to the approach of developing new materials from renewable sources altogether. 
A big challenge that must be faced during the recycling process is sorting the waste materials. To ensure that the recycled materials are produced to a certain standard the sorting process has to meet a certain reliability criteria. Another important factor is efficiency, especially in industrial waste processing where large amounts of plastic waste are handled in a certain amount of time so the sorting process has to be able to keep up with these rates. 
The goal of this project is to combine both aspects, reliability and speed and investigate a low-cost method of visual discrimination of different kinds of plastics.
