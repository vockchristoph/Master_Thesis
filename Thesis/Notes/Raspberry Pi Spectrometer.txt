PySpectrometer:

Commercially available spectrometers have been implemented in a variety of different applications and can be used to analyse different spectrums of light in a number of different resolutions. Although these devices are extremely accurate they can cost upwards of 10.000,00 Euros. The PySpectrometer uses of the shelf components to create a cheap but effective spectrometer. The original motivation for this project was to build a tool for testing the frequency of lasers. The PySpectrometer is based on a Raspberry Pie 4 and utilises Python libraries ( OpenCV and Tkinter) to capture and analyse spectrograms.
